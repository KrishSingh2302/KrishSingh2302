# Hi, I'm Krish 👋

**Who am I?**  
An engineering student passionate about embedded systems, FPGA design, and digital signal processing. I enjoy working close to the hardware—writing RTL, testing on real boards, and understanding how things work at the lowest level.

**What am I currently working on?**  
I’m building projects around FPGA-based signal processing, baseband communication chains, and ARM-based embedded systems. Most of my current work involves Verilog, RTL design, and experimenting on the Zybo Z7.

**Tools & Tech I use:**  
Verilog · Vivado · MATLAB/Simulink · Python · C/C++ · ARM Toolchain · Git/GitHub
